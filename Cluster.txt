Node Management
-------Shutting Down a Node in a Cluster (vSphere Web Client)------
1. Log on to vCenter Server by using vSphere Web Client.
2. If DRS is not enabled, manually migrate all the VMs except the Controller VM another host in the 
cluster or shut down any VMs other than the Controller VM that you do not want to migrate to 
another host.
If DRS is enabled skip to the next step.
3. Right-click the host and select Maintenance Mode > Enter Maintenance Mode.
4. In the Confirm Maintenance Mode, click OK.
5. Log on to the Controller VM with SSH and shut down the Controller VM.
(command line) nutanix@cvm$ cvm_shutdown -P now
6. After the Controller VM shuts down, wait for the host to go into maintenance mode.
7. Right-click the host and select Shut Down.

Adding a node to a cluster
1. Log into Prism Element of the desired
13
2. Click on the cog wheel in the upper right corner and select expand cluster
3. Select the host/s that you want to add and click next
4. Download the CSRâ€™s for the servers that are going to be added to the cluster
5. Submit the certificates to the team responsible for KMS
6. Once the certificates are received navigate to the cog wheel in the upper right corner and click 
on expand cluster
7. Select the host/s that you would like to add to the cluster
8. Upload the certificates
9. Proceed with adding the nodes to the cluster

-----------------Starting a Node in a Cluster-----------------
1. Log on to a running Controller VM in the cluster with SSH.
2. Start the Controller VM.
nutanix@cvm$ ~/serviceability/bin/esx-exit-maintenance-mode -s cvm_ip_addr
If successful, this command produces no output. If if it fails, wait 5 minutes and try again.
nutanix@cvm$ ~/serviceability/bin/esx-start-cvm -s cvm_ip_addr
Replace cvm_ip_addr with the IP address of the Controller VM.
If the Controller VM starts, a message like the following is displayed.
INFO esx-start-cvm:67 CVM started successfully. Please verify using ping cvm_ip_addr
After starting, the Controller VM restarts once. Wait three to four minutes before you ping the 
Controller VM.
Alternatively, you can take the ESXi host out of maintenance mode and start the Controller VM 
using the vSphere Web Client.
3. Verify that all services are up on all Controller VMs.
nutanix@cvm$ cluster status
------------

4. Verify storage.
a. Log on to the ESXi host with SSH.
b. Rescan for datastores.
root@esx# esxcli storage core adapter rescan --all
c. Confirm that cluster VMFS datastores, if any, are available.
root@esx# esxcfg-scsidevs -m | awk '{print $5}'
